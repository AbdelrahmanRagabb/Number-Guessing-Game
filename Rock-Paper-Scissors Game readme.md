README
Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository! This readme provides an overview of the code I have contributed for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C programming.

Project Description
In this project, I have developed a program that allows users to play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The program is implemented in C programming language and provides an interactive experience for users to test their strategy and enjoy the game.

Features
Play against the computer: Test your skills against a formidable computer opponent.
User-friendly interface: Enjoy a seamless and intuitive game experience.
Realistic gameplay: The program faithfully simulates the rules and dynamics of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
Instant feedback: Receive immediate results and discover who emerges as the ultimate champion.
Endless entertainment: Engage in multiple rounds and challenge yourself to improve your strategy.


Getting Started
To run the Rock-Paper-Scissors game code, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
https://github.com/AbdelrahmanRagabb/TECHNOHACKS-EDUTECH-Internship.git
Open the code file in a C programming IDE or editor.
Compile and build the code.
Execute the compiled program to start playing the game.
Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system to successfully compile and run the code.

How to Play
Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions.
Enter your choice of move: 'R' for Rock, 'P' for Paper, or 'S' for Scissors.
The computer will randomly choose its move.
The program will determine the winner based on the game rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
The scores of the computer (CSCORE) and the player (USCORE) will be displayed after each round.
Continue playing rounds until you decide to exit the program.
Contributions and Feedback
I welcome contributions and feedback to improve the code further. If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please feel free to submit them via GitHub's issue tracker.

Thank you for your interest in my Rock-Paper-Scissors game code! I hope you enjoy playing the game. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
