# Number Guessing Program

Welcome to the Number Guessing Program! This interactive program asks users to guess a number between 1 and 100, providing helpful hints until they find the correct answer.

## Description

The Number Guessing Program is a fun and educational application that challenges your guessing skills. It was developed as a project under the guidance of Sandip Gavit, my mentor at TechnoHacks EduTech Official.

The program prompts users to enter their guesses and provides hints to guide them in the right direction. With each guess, the program lets users know if their guess is too high or too low, helping them narrow down the possibilities. The goal is to guess the correct number in the fewest attempts possible.
